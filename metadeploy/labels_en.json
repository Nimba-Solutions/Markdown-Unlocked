Perfect for documentation and rich text formatting, it brings the power and flexibility of markdown directly to your Salesforce org with easy installation and lightweight, extensible, design.\r\n\r\n> In the age of AI where complex codebases are refactored in minutes by sophisticated agents - you gave us a utility that tells us: \u201cyes, that is indeed a bulletpoint.\u201d\r\n>\r\n> ~ with love, \r\n> CP\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Seamless integration of marked.js with Salesforce Lightning Web Components\r\n- Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)\r\n- Automatic line breaks for better readability\r\n- Robust error handling and logging\r\n- Lightweight and performant implementation\r\n- Easy to use and extend\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe package consists of two main Lightning Web Components:\r\n\r\n1. `markdownRenderer`: The core component that handles markdown rendering\r\n   - Dynamically loads the marked.js library\r\n   - Supports all standard markdown syntax\r\n   - Configurable rendering options\r\n   - Built-in error handling and fallback display\r\n\r\n2. `logger`: A utility component for consistent logging across the application\r\n   - Debug, info, warning, and error level logging\r\n   - Detailed error tracking and reporting\r\n   - Helps with troubleshooting and maintenance\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the markdown renderer in your Lightning Web Components, simply pass a markdown string into `markdown-content` slot:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n    <c-markdown-renderer markdown-content={markdownContent}></c-markdown-renderer>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo work on this project in a scratch org:\r\n\r\n1. [Set up CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)\r\n2. Run `cci flow run dev_org --org dev` to deploy this project.\r\n3.
